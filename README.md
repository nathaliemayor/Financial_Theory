1. Calculation of returns, volatility and Sharpe ratio of single stocks as well as portfolios. Creation of (i) an equally weighted portfolio, (ii) a low volatility portfolio and (iii) a high momentum portfolio and analysis of their relative performance. 
2. Computation of the mean-variance efficient frontier and tangency portfolio given an investment universe. Given an investor's expected utility (preferences), computation of the optimal investor portfolio.
3. Computation of monthly correlation matrices. Computation and visualization of the time-series of mean, max and minimum correlation. Compute and visualization of the monthly time path of an equally weighted portfolio over the same observation horizon.
